# BouncingBall
This is a test website to host a p5 project that I just recently learned, mostly from Prof Evan Peck.
My p5js editor for this repository [<a href = "https://editor.p5js.org/xmeng/sketches/CGur40qtP">https://editor.p5js.org/xmeng/sketches/CGur40qtP</a>].
Below is a screenshot of the program. Note the program actually generates a video the balls bounce back and forth inside a pre-defined screen frame.
